# About my first project on GitHub
I created my first project with HTML and CSS. Since I literally started learning a few hours ago I basicly just copyed from a youtube video. I made some little changes but it is still 95% the same as the video. 

This is the video I used for reference -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHb9JobDs2o

Note: It's my first time coding and using Github so I had no idea on how to properly upload my project.
      I am going to try to do all of the projects listed here -> https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv
